# dotfiles

These are my `.files`. The structure is based off of [Bryan Veloso's dotfiles][bv].

## Installation

Run the following in your shell:

    curl https://raw.github.com/lukeman/dotfiles/master/suit_up.sh | sh

(Assumes zsh and my way of doing things, so be warned.)

## Updating

Use the `upgrade_dotfiles` alias.
